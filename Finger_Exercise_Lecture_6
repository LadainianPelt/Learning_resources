#Assume you are given an integer 0 <= N <= 1000. Write a piece of Python code that uses bisection search to guess N. The code prints two lines: count: with how many guesses it took to find N, and answer: with the value of N. Hints: If the halfway value is exactly in between two integers, choose the smaller one.
low = 0
high = 1001
guess = (high+low)//2
count = 1
n = int(input("125: "))
while guess != N:
    if guess < N:
        low = guess
    else:
        high = guess
    guess = (high+low)//2
    count += 1
print("count:", count)
print("answer:", guess)
